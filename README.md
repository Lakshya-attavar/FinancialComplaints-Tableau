## Insights Deep Dive:

- By **categorising the complaints by issue**, it can be observed that **“Managing the account”** was the top concern with 8849 complaints, followed by “deposits and withdrawals”. There was only 1 complaint with issue “problem with credit report or credit score” making it the issue with least complaints.

- **By Region**: The states of **California** , New York, Florida, Texas and New Jersey are the top 5 for the most number of complaints.
- **By Products**: Majority of the complaints received were with regard to **credit cards (19,176 complaints)** while vehicle loan or lease having the least no. of complaints. Credit Card, Checking or Savings account, Mortgage, Credit card or prepaid card, Bank account or service are the 5 product categories with more than average (9439) complaints.
- 9.8% of complaints were disputed by the consumers, which is a good indication of satisfied customers.

## Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings,

- The company should **look into issues and sub-issues regarding “Managing the account”** as the consumers have filed highest number of complaints concerning it.
    - The same goes for “Deposits and Withdrawals” too since the number of complaints are relatively high.
    - Providing an easy-access user guide to managing the account and steps to Deposits and Withdrawals might help resolve the issue.
    - Monitoring the sub-issues areas will help reduce the complaints at a granular level.
- Looking into the issues and products tagged with the complaints from California and other top 4 states might give a better idea of the most problematic issues and products among larger consumer bases.
- **Credit card,  Checking or Savings account and Mortgage** are the products that need to be taken to careful consideration while resolving issues to keep the complaints to minimum.
- Majority of the complaints disputed have been “closed with an explanation” to the customer. Checking in with the customer to make sure they are satisfied with the service and getting feedback would help reduce consumer disputes.
